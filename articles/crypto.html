           In Stock investment, you buy a company's shares of ownership when it's low and cheap to sell when it's high and expensive, holding for as many years as one intends to. Most 80s and 90s richest men were the investors and beneficiaries of this investment. Like stock investment, Cryptocurrencies are bought low and sold high.<br/><br/>
           Active investing is highly recommended when it comes to Cryptocurrencies investments - buying and selling tokens within weeks or months of holding. Unlike stocks, a token can bullish up to 1000% in 2 months or less, a stock will take years to accomplish the same result. Waiting on a token for years can be a regrettable action as some top coins in 2015 did not make it to 2022.<br/><br/>
           Blockchain technology, Cryptocurrencies are still evolving no one has it all entirely figured out yet. So, people do not sleep on it.<br/><br/>
           <strong>How to invest in Cryptocurrencies.</strong><br/>
           I got acquainted with DEXs (decentralized exchanges). This is where you find coin that just launch with small market cap and High return potential. Smart inventors look for projects with small market cap, why? A project with $ 1 million market cap would give 1000% ROI when the market cap reaches $10 million market cap and since DEXS are where they are first listed, that's where the magic happens. DEXs are where you "catch them young" to reap more benefit before they get listed on CEXs (centralized exchanges) Such as Binance, coinbase etc. One can make a whopping 10-100x when you catch a coin young.<br/><br/>
           By the time a coin is listed on CEXs you're already late because this is where early adopters are going to be taking their profits, when the market cap is already huge. Although it is already late, CEXs listing is not the end of a coin, in fact it's actually a new beginning for new investors, as early adopters are already existing the market. One advantage of CEXs over DEXs is that, a scam coin will hardly ever make it to a CEX. Thereby cutting the chances of being rug pulled and REKT.<br/><br/>
           Bottomline, I use DEXs because I love to be a early adopters and I understand the risk involved and I'm willing to take the risks. People who invest in projects after CEXs listing are also smart investors.<br/><br/>
           To successfully invest in Cryptocurrency projects you have to :<br/>

              <li class="ordered-list">BE KEEN ON RESEARCH: in this game, it is pertinent to develop the habit of doing research - at least, if the intention is money making. There are over 19,000 Cryptos on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">CMC.</a> It's hard to keep track of every coin, research will do the narrowing down to the best performing coin.<br/>
              Twitter is the best place to start. Every coin has their own twitter accounts where news and updates about the coins are shared. Advanced search on Twitter comes in handy.<br/><br/>
              Also, follow crypto investors on Twitter, follow their followers to get access to top coins. An investor has 200,000 followers and Twitted about a coin, best believe that, at least 50% of their followers will shill the same coin. It will lead to exposure to the direction of many excellent coins capable of giving huge ROI. CMC provides adequate information about a coin - the market cap, all time high, all time low, charts, rank, time of movements and many more useful metrics- which enhances smart decision making.<br/><br/>
              Now that we have our coin(s), what we do next is due diligence. 
              </li>
              <li class="ordered-list">
                DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE: A coin is listed on DEX does not mean it is genuine. A lot of projects launch directly on UNISWAP providing users with fast access to a broad range of tokens because it is completely decentralized. Unfortunately, due of its decentralized nature, anyone can list fake coins too, tricking inexperienced users into swapping assets with sham tokens that are worthless. Study projects white paper to determine a real gem from sham tokens. White paper of a project encompasses every detailed information of that project - the purpose, road map, hidden potential, core values etc. - It's all time consuming but it's always worth it in the end. Study the white paper, Make sure it make sense to you before buying.<br/><br/>
                Here are the tools I use before making a buy decision;<br/>
                <ul>
                  <li>Coin Market Cap (CMC): to check information/ metrics of the coins such as ATH, ATL, MC, Market volume. Projects with low MC like $1 million are good projects with high return potential</li>
                  <li>DEXSCREENER.IO : For technical analysis. Its features enables carrying out neat analysis and also calculates the potential percentage increment of the coins to the all time high. You don't want to buy an asset at the top, you want to buy the dip and sell the pump. That is the heartbeat of every business and investment. There are people who puts money on coins when it's already making moves, if market unfortunately starts pulling back after they buy and such people label such token as rug pull which is not. Get your analysis game right, check the daily, weekly and monthly time frame before making a buy decision. Be a smart investor. According to Rich dad, your profit is made when you buy... Not when you sell.</li>
                  <li>Poocoin.app : exhibits the same features as DEXSCREENER and in addition, it provides information about other wallets buying and selling the coin.</li>
