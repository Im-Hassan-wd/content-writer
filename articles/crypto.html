           In Stock investment, you buy a company's shares of ownership when it's low and cheap to sell when it's high and expensive, holding for as many years as one intends to. Most 80s and 90s richest men were the investors and beneficiaries of this investment. Like stock investment, Cryptocurrencies are bought low and sold high.
