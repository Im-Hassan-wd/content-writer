           In Stock investment, you buy a company's shares of ownership when it's low and cheap to sell when it's high and expensive, holding for as many years as one intends to. Most 80s and 90s richest men were the investors and beneficiaries of this investment. Like stock investment, Cryptocurrencies are bought low and sold high.<br/><br/>
           Active investing is highly recommended when it comes to Cryptocurrencies investments - buying and selling tokens within weeks or months of holding. Unlike stocks, a token can bullish up to 1000% in 2 months or less, a stock will take years to accomplish the same result. Waiting on a token for years can be a regrettable action as some top coins in 2015 did not make it to 2022.<br/><br/>
           Blockchain technology, Cryptocurrencies are still evolving no one has it all entirely figured out yet. So, people do not sleep on it.<br/><br/>
