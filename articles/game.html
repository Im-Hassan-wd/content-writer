            It encourages reasoning, improves intelligence and enhances overall problem solving skills. It is one of my most recommended ways of putting my brain to use. And as way relaxation at the same time. Yes, I said relaxation. Contrary to what I (and probably many others like myself) was made to believe game does to a human brain. "Don't play games" they said. "your academic will suffer" they said. Well, my academics didn't suffer, in fact games help my academics and I definitely turned out great. However, it may not be the same story for everyone.

            <span>I love candy crush.</span> 
            <br/> 
            <br/> 
            Candy crush is a game of sweet, candies and chocolate. Colorful and alluring to the eyes. Yikes! Candy crush was designed by King. King is a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world, they have developed more than 200 fun titles, and offer games that are enjoyed all around the world. Their franchises include Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch<a href="https://www.king.com/corporate-and-media" target="_blank"> read more.</a> Candy crush came to being on 14th of April 2012 and has since then captured the soul of many game lovers. Candy crush is played by swiping candies in different directions to create sets of 3 or more candies. When matched, the candies will be crushed and candies above will be shifted, allowing one to accomplish a series of different goals. 
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            The goal of playing candy crush is to clear as many rows and column in as fewer moves as possible. However, the objectives changes as the levels proceeds. Winning a game unlocks the next level, losing a game means life lost and it causes the level to resets. Lives automatically regenerates after 30 minutes to have the opportunity to start the level again after initial failure.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            Here is how it works, when 3 candies are matched in a row , they are cleared from the board. When 4 candies are matched, it will create a special candy Combo which will burst an entire row if matched with another set of 3 or more candies. When 5 candies are matched to form a T or L shape, a wrapped candy will be created which will explode a square of candies surrounding that tile and also explode subsequent x3 block.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            Here is my favorite part and my most used technique to reach my goals quickly. Matching 5 candies in a single row will create a round shaped chocolate with a sprinkle of different colours. When this chocolate is matched with any candy of any color, it will crush and remove the entire candy of that particular color on the board. The process of it will create sparkling rainbow light like one is in a party with disco light and candies falling from the sky. I love it.  
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            There are boosters that helps one win a level when one is stuck, frustrated or unable to continue. One is lollipop hammer which helps in crushing candy(ies), and reshuffle candy that enables the swaping of candy(ies) with the nearest ones.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            When candies are smartly and rightly matched, it results in over-achievement Of the level's objectives, (It May be exceeding the target score or achieving the goals before the given time) which of course is a good thing, and the star rating box gets filled quickly, signifying you're one of the best to play the particular level. 
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            One's intelligence, problems solving skills and time consciousness is tested by the limited moves given to a player. For example, I have 15 moves to achieve a 100,000 target score and get 3 stars from the level (it's a personal preference to get 3 stars from every level). What I'd do is find an opportunity of matching 5 candies in a single row to get a round chocolate and look for another opportunity not so far from the chocolate to match another 5 candies to create a T or L shape to get a wrapped candy. Then afterwards match the chocolate and the wrapped candy to crush and clear and entire board. This will increase my chance of achieving the objective and even quicker and without exhausting my moves or exceeding the time given.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            By the above technique, I'll achieve these results : 
            <ul>
                <li>Finish the game without having to re-play the level </li>
                <li>Finish the game quicker and faster </li>
                <li>Achieve the objective </li>
                <li>Not exceed the given time or moves. In fact, have extra times and moves left after achieving the objective. </li>
                <li>Get a 3-stars signifying I'm a star player of that level. </li>
                <li>Unlock the next level. </li>
            </ul>
