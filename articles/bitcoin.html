            BITCOIN PROBABLE EXTINCTION?<br/>
            While the newbie crypto investors and analysts were blindly arguing and refusing to accept an explicit, practical and inevitable drawdown in the bitcoin price action owing to a long overstretched market price between late 2020 and 2021, the experienced investors were exiting the market and getting their money off the bitcoin table -huge profit included- and patiently waiting and saving their capital for the major pullback to seize another opportunity at the market at a more cheaper price.<br/><br/>
            I recalled the time a fellow crypto enthusiast showed me the technical analysis his mentor did on the bitcoin chart around August of last year, 2021, my heart dropped, literally. Raj as he is fondly called, is a Pakistani financial analyst, stock exchange, Cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange markets, commodities trading, name it. He is a guru in analysis and chart interpretation, he specializes in long term trading.  This is the guy who predicted BTC dropping to around $4000 from $12,000 in 2020 and that was exactly what played out. And from $4k rallied to a whopping $69,000 in 2021. He also predicted and waited for ethereum to plunge about 95% from $1400 to $70 in the same 2020 after he analyzed the market. He invested a huge sum and bought at $70. He raked in hundreds of millions of dollars as ethereum reaches a whopping $5000 in 2021.<br/><br/>
            The analysis that made my heart drop was a prove of a bearish possibility in the bitcoin market from $69,000 to some $12,000. That is about 80% fall in the btc price, about $57,000 drawdown. This has got to be the biggest fall in the history of falls. Anyone would argue about it playing out that way. Bitcoin has gone far up to come that far down. People were expecting some 10 - 20 thousand dollars fall not some $57,000 but wall Street didn't think so. Market always has its pattern.<br/><br/>
