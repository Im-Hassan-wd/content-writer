            BITCOIN PROBABLE EXTINCTION?<br/>
            While the newbie crypto investors and analysts were blindly arguing and refusing to accept an explicit, practical and inevitable drawdown in the bitcoin price action owing to a long overstretched market price between late 2020 and 2021, the experienced investors were exiting the market and getting their money off the bitcoin table -huge profit included- and patiently waiting and saving their capital for the major pullback to seize another opportunity at the market at a more cheaper price.<br/><br/>
            I recalled the time a fellow crypto enthusiast showed me the technical analysis his mentor did on the bitcoin chart around August of last year, 2021, my heart dropped, literally. Raj as he is fondly called, is a Pakistani financial analyst, stock exchange, Cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange markets, commodities trading, name it. He is a guru in analysis and chart interpretation, he specializes in long term trading.  This is the guy who predicted BTC dropping to around $4000 from $12,000 in 2020 and that was exactly what played out. And from $4k rallied to a whopping $69,000 in 2021. He also predicted and waited for ethereum to plunge about 95% from $1400 to $70 in the same 2020 after he analyzed the market. He invested a huge sum and bought at $70. He raked in hundreds of millions of dollars as ethereum reaches a whopping $5000 in 2021.<br/><br/>
            The analysis that made my heart drop was a prove of a bearish possibility in the bitcoin market from $69,000 to some $12,000. That is about 80% fall in the btc price, about $57,000 drawdown. This has got to be the biggest fall in the history of falls. Anyone would argue about it playing out that way. Bitcoin has gone far up to come that far down. People were expecting some 10 - 20 thousand dollars fall not some $57,000 but wall Street didn't think so. Market always has its pattern.<br/><br/>
            Many investors have experienced major investment losses over the bitcoin in the past 
            8 months and still counting and have their mental health paying dearly the price. BTC has only dropped a 75%, currently at $17,700. The hope has turned into regrets for most of them. There is still some $5000 to reach the targeted demand zone below that seems unbreakable (by this time, it would have dropped by 84%) and would aid the bitcoin rally hopefully to a new all time high.<br/><br/>
            The newbie bitcoiners were ready to argue till heaven falls that it was an impossibility for btc pullback from a $69,000 price to some $12,000. Well, it looked impossible until now that it's playing out. Even "impossible" says "I'm possible."<br/><br/>
            At this stage, we're over the "the worst is yet to happen to bitcoin" phrase, we're already living the worst of bitcoin in the history of bitcoin. The good news is, we're almost there. What is left to touchdown to 12k is nothing compared to how far down we've come. 
            Many analysts have concluded that there are similarities in the 2020 and 2021 bitcoin chart. So market will definitely play out, after touching the 12k zone, I the same way it played out after touching the 4k zone in 2020.<br/><br/>
            The sweetness after the sorrowful BTC plunge is the creation of new supply zone. The creation of new investment opportunity in the bitcoin market. Investors who took advantage of the 2020 drop to $4k and exited the market $69k made 1600% ROI. It means that, a $10,000 investment would amount to $160,000.<br/><br/>
            Bitcoin is not going extinct neither is it dropping dead. It has done this before and it will do it again. Markets have their patterns. I understand there is panic in the market and many losses leaving some bitcoin investors especially the newbies totally loosing faith in the whole crypto market at large. But it is what it is.<br/><br/>
            However, the aftermath of this huge drop in the bitcoin price is creating a ponzi scheme ides in the head of investors especially the new investors who bought at the top, say $50k or 60k. The impatient investors may never believe in any crypto project again and may never consider banking on them.<br/>
