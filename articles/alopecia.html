           Because of the typical African mentality of associating spirituality with every of her inexplicable situations or circumstances, a Nigerian bride to - be took her own life, seven days to her wedding day.<br/><br/>
           Omashola was a beautiful young lady hoping to get married to the love of her life. Unknown to the groom nor anyone else in her life - not even her mother or her sister with whom she shares all of her secrets - Omashola has been dealing with hair loss for over 10 months. Hair loss sometime can be normal, they may grow back with time. In Nigeria, we believe one has to shed some hair to give room for more growth.<br/><br/>
           At first, it was normal hair loss, it will grow back. But no, it was getting worse by the weeks. Thank goodness for wigs, they were saving Oma's butt and helping her keep her embarrassing secret, from her fiancee especially.<br/><br/>
