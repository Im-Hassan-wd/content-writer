           Because of the typical African mentality of associating spirituality with every of her inexplicable situations or circumstances, a Nigerian bride to - be took her own life, seven days to her wedding day.<br/><br/>
           Omashola was a beautiful young lady hoping to get married to the love of her life. Unknown to the groom nor anyone else in her life - not even her mother or her sister with whom she shares all of her secrets - Omashola has been dealing with hair loss for over 10 months. Hair loss sometime can be normal, they may grow back with time. In Nigeria, we believe one has to shed some hair to give room for more growth.<br/><br/>
           At first, it was normal hair loss, it will grow back. But no, it was getting worse by the weeks. Thank goodness for wigs, they were saving Oma's butt and helping her keep her embarrassing secret, from her fiancee especially.<br/><br/>
           There is this popular black women slogan, "hair is the beauty of a woman." kunle, Oma's fiancee, loves black thick Afro hair on a black woman and loves the regular local all back simple hairstyle that the cutting comb has cut beautifully and clearly, showing the brown skinned scalp.<br/><br/>
           They day Kunle was going to find out about Oma's secret, it was exactly a week to their big day. There was already 3 missed calls from kunle on Oma's phone, she was in the showers singing along to the song that was playing on the stereo, too loud for her to hear her phone ring. Since Oma wasn't picking her call, Kunle thought to drop by and explain some things the event planner had brought to his notice about the venue of their wedding, earlier that morning.<br/><br/>
           Oma was already in her bedroom dressing up, she sighted her patched, rough, half bald head in the mirror and she quickly ran into depression. Kunle barged in on her, she might have forgotten to lock the door earlier. Sighting Oma's patched head, he almost fainted, he was scared and dumbfounded, he rushed out of the room. <br/> <br/>
           Oma was mad at herself, how could she have let this happen.<br/><br/>
           Kunle cut off the wedding.<br/><br/>
           Oma pleaded with Kunle, she explained the level of insecurity she's had and how she's been embarrassed to talk to him about it. But nothing was going to change his mind, he had discussed the issue with his mum and siblings and they've all agreed Oma was a witch that has used her hair as sacrifice in her cult. Typical right? <br/><br/>
           There was so much tension between the two families. It is such a embarrassing thing for Oma's family, their daughters fiancee breaking up with her, few days to their wedding. It was a bad omen in any Nigerian culture.<br/>
           Oma was in her widowed mother's home weeping. Her sister was weeping for her and consoling her at the same time. That was the saddest day of her mum's life.<br/><br/>
           Oma wasn't a witch, her mum knew he daughter a good Christian child. But what happened to her hair? Even her septogenarian mum still has all of her dark beautiful afro hair intact.<br/><br/>
           Apparently none of them know about ALOPECIA. <br/><br/>
           There was so much plea from the bride - to - be's family to the groom-to-be's but nothing positive was forthcoming. Looked like they were hell bent on not making a WITCH a wife. <br/><br/>
           The shame was too much for Oma, she couldn't bear it, it was too much. She may never be able to get a man that'd marry her. She may never be able to look herself in the mirror. She may never have that confidence. Her self esteem has been crushed. Oh! Poor Oma. <br/>
           She committed suicide after realizing her life could only get worse from here.<br/><br/><br/>
           WHAT IS ALOPECIA<br/><br/>
           Alopecia is hair loss from the scalp or elsewhere on the body. A sudden hair loss that starts with one or more circular bald patches that may overlap, then becoming more noticeable.

               <li>1.77 for African American.</li>
               <li>1.27 for other races, including native Americans and Pacific islanders.</li>
               <li>1 for white people.</li>
               <li>0.9 for Hispanic.</li>
               <li>0.4 for Asians.</li>
           </ul>
           It affects over 7 million people in the United States alone. <a href="https://healthline.com/health/alopecia-areata" target="_blank">Read more about Alopecia.</a>
