            Hey honey, I'm off to work <br/>
            Hey mom, I'm going to work <br/>
            Hey, please call me later I'm at work <br/>
            <br/> 
            Seems like work is such a happy place to be... Or maybe not (always)
            <br/> 
            <br/> 
            It is quite disturbing and hard keeping up with people's unpleasant experiences with their bosses at their workplaces that was shared on Twitter and other social media platforms this past week. 
            Toxicity and narcissistic behavior doesn't seem to be limited to a courting or marriage relationships. It flourishes across all human relationships including but not limited to employer and employee relationship.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            For most people, work is home. Work is their get away from real life troubles. Work is the balance and where it all makes sense. Imagine being one of these people and unfortunately being an employee to a narcissistic boss who verbally abuses you at the slightest opportunity. Labeling you animalistic features and using some vulgar, uncouth, curse and demeaning word at you.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            Then Comes in fear, loss of confidence, anxiety, lack of self expression, the feeling of not being good enough and depression sets in. And sometimes, coupled with real life troubles, suicidal thoughts.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            Narcissist have always been narcissist, will always be narcissistic. Therefore, no matter how little or tiny, when showed or noticed in an employer, it shouldn't be ignored or overlooked. The feeling of "it won't be that bad, I'll be able to cope" will set in but always train your mind to consider and choose your mental health. Take to your heels and find a better alternative of job. 
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            In a saner clime, the rights of employees are protected by the constitution. Here in Nigeria, even if these rights are protected under the law, we all know that there's no working systems. Employers will act blind to these laws and display egocentric behaviours all they want because this is Nigeria, and there's no consequences. 
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            It all boils down to corruption, incompetence and absolute zero regards to fundamental human rights on the part of our politicians and law makers. 
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            These employers should be subjected to some sort of check and balance. And the rights of the employees who speaks out about the true nature of their employers should be protected.
